A loop resolution Hi-C map showing all contacts within an 700kb genomic interval, generated using HCT-116 human
colorectal carcinoma cells. Loops, which form here due to physical tethering between two CTCF- and cohesin-bound loci,
manifest as bright peaks away from the diagonal. Contact domains, genomic intervals that exhibit enhanced contact
frequency within themselves, manifest as bright squares along the diagonal. When the two anchors of a loop demarcate
a contact domain, the resulting feature is called a "loop domain".  Left: A loop resolution Hi-C map showing

is called a "loop domain". Right: The same region in HCT-116 cells after the RAD21 subunit of the cohesin complex has
been degraded using an auxin-inducible degron system. The loop domains all disappear completely, demonstrating that
they are dependent on cohesin.
